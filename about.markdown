My name is Theo Sandstrom, and I am a sophomore at Yale University
majoring in Mathematics and Linguistics. Other interests include
music, electronics, and computing. Right now, I use this site mostly
for school, as a place to accumulate and store notes, assignments, and
anything else that I find useful or entertaining.
